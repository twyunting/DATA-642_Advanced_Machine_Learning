We describe the algorithm's efficiency depending on the increasing size of the input data when we use the Big-$O$ notation (n). The ideal time complexity is $O(1)$. $O(1)$ means it takes a constant time no matter the size of data. Knowing the algorithm's time complexity with a input data is able to help us organize our resources, process, and deliver results more efficiently and effectively. As a result, when we write down the algorithms, we should try to reduce the operation time.\n","\n","When solving a quadratic programming task, it requires decompose the task into smaller ones, such as SMO and SVM algorithm. In this process, Big-O tells you the complexity of an algorithm in terms of the size of its inputs. With Big-O Notation, we use the size of the input, which we call “N”. So we can say things like the runtime grows “on the order of the size of the input” (O(N)) (linear) or “on the order of the square of the size of the input” (O(N²)) (quadratic).\n","\n","Using the Big-O notation, the resulting algorithm is very efficient. Especially for the case of linear SVM, the complexity becomes of order O(N).\n","It's not that Big-O notation itself will help you. It's that if you understand Big-O notation, you understand the worst-case complexity of algorithms. Essentially, Big-O gives you a high-level sense of which algorithms are fast, which are slow, and what the tradeoffs are.\n","\n","\n","For instance, if the input is a string, the n will be the string's length.
